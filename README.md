# TranscriptionComponent

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

It is composed of one component (screen) and one service (state-service).

The screen component is a placeholder for all the UI screens, hence contains abstractions of UI screens as strings, and abstractions of the next available screens a current UI screen can access as an array of strings. Refer to `state_space` in `screen.component.ts`.

The service has setter and getter functions. You can treat this as a mock service and inject it into the transcription component you will be developing.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
